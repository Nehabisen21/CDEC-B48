  - Network Virtualization: Abstracting network resources into a manageable virtual framework.

- **Key Benefits**:
  - Efficient resource utilization
  - Cost savings
  - Scalability
  - Simplified management

#### **Deep Dive Knowledge**:
- Virtualization uses a hypervisor (like VMware or VirtualBox) to manage VMs.
- Popular tools include KVM, Xen, and Microsoft Hyper-V.
- Real-time Example: A company can run a legacy Windows app on a Linux server using virtualization.

#### **Simple Explanation**:
- Think of virtualization as renting rooms in a house (the physical machine) where each room (VM) has its own tenant (OS).

### 2. **Virtualization vs Cloud**
- Virtualization is a foundational technology; cloud computing builds on it.
- **Comparison Table**:
  | **Feature**          | **Virtualization**                     | **Cloud Computing**                       |
