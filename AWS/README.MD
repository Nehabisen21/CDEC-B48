# Introduction to Virtualization and Cloud Computing

Welcome to the **AWS Batch Day 1** session! This document provides an overview of the topics we'll cover today, along with helpful resources and instructions for hands-on practice.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to Virtualization**
- **What is Virtualization?**
  - Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
  
- **Types of Virtualization**
  - Server Virtualization: Multiple virtual servers on one physical machine.
  - Storage Virtualization: Combining multiple physical storage devices into a single virtual unit.
  - Network Virtualization: Abstracting network resources into a manageable virtual framework.

- **Key Benefits**:
  - Efficient resource utilization
  - Cost savings
  - Scalability
  - Simplified management

#### **Deep Dive Knowledge**:
- Virtualization uses a hypervisor (like VMware or VirtualBox) to manage VMs.
- Popular tools include KVM, Xen, and Microsoft Hyper-V.
- Real-time Example: A company can run a legacy Windows app on a Linux server using virtualization.

#### **Simple Explanation**:
- Think of virtualization as renting rooms in a house (the physical machine) where each room (VM) has its own tenant (OS).

### 2. **Virtualization vs Cloud**
- Virtualization is a foundational technology; cloud computing builds on it.
- **Comparison Table**:
  | **Feature**          | **Virtualization**                     | **Cloud Computing**                       |
  |-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
  | **Definition**        | Technology to create virtual environments. | Delivery of on-demand computing resources via the internet. |
  | **Deployment**        | Local (on-premises servers).           | Hosted on the internet.                   |
  | **Scalability**       | Limited by physical hardware.          | Highly scalable without physical limits.  |
  | **Access**            | Internal network only.                | Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. |

#### **Deep Dive Knowledge**:
- Virtualization focuses on optimizing hardware usage, while cloud emphasizes service delivery and flexibility.
- Real-time Example: Virtualization is like owning apartments in a building, whereas cloud is like Airbnb where anyone can rent as needed.

### 3. **Cloud Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)**
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
  - Virtualized hardware resources.
  - **Examples**: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
  - **Real-time Example**: Hosting a website on AWS EC2 where you control the OS and applications.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
  - Platforms for application development.
  - **Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.
  - **Real-time Example**: Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy a web app without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
  - Software accessible over the internet.
  - **Examples**: Gmail, Salesforce.
  - **Real-time Example**: Using Google Docs to collaborate on documents in real-time.

#### **Simple Explanation**:
- **IaaS**: Like renting a raw apartment and furnishing it yourself.
- **PaaS**: Like renting a fully furnished apartment but adding your own decorations.
- **SaaS**: Like booking a hotel room where everything is ready.

### 4. **AWS Account Creation**

Follow these steps to create your AWS account:
1. Visit [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
2. **Sign Up**:
   - Enter your email address and password.
   - Create an account name.
3. **Account Type**: Choose "Personal" or "Professional."
4. **Payment Method**: Add a valid credit/debit card for identity verification.
5. **Verify Identity**: Enter your mobile number for OTP verification.
6. **Select Support Plan**: Choose "Basic (Free)."
7. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

#### **Deep Dive Knowledge**:
- AWS Free Tier offers 12 months of free services like EC2, S3, and Lambda with usage limits.
- Real-time Example: Use the free tier to deploy a simple static website using S3 and monitor costs via the AWS Billing Dashboard.

## Hands-On Practice
- **Objective**: Create an AWS account and explore the Management Console.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Sign up for an AWS account using the steps above.
  2. Navigate through the AWS Console to identify key services like EC2, S3, and RDS.
